Are you from UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§? Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦? India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³? and use the word colour? and you realized that there is no colour in Windows Command Prompt well this is very easy to code and I still don't know why Microsoft didn't add this

### Setup
download this `colour.bat` and copy that to
```lua
C:\Windows\
```
and done! now open `cmd.exe` and type `colour`
